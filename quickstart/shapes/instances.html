  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Start up two instances of the Shapes Demo for this example. You should be able to see two application windows like so:</p>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/shapes-demo/two-instances.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Publish</b> - Let's change it up and begin this example by publishing a triangle by selecting <code>Triangle</code> from the top Shape dropdown menu. Then click the <code>Publish</code> button. You should observe a green triangle bouncing around the application window's display area. The triangle, from a DDS perspective, is a piece of information that is being published to the rest of the system for other entities to receive if they are set up to be interested in triangles.</p>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/shapes-demo/two-instances-pub-triangle.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Subscribe</b> - In the other application window, select <code>Triangle</code> from the bottom Shape dropdown menu. Then click the <code>Subscribe</code> button. You should observe the green triangle, published by the first application instance bouncing around the display area in the application window you chose to subscribe in.</p>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/shapes-demo/pub-sub-triangle.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Results</b> - The triangle in the subscriber's window, tracking the initial triangle from the publisher's window, exemplifies the DDS publish/subscribe paradigm for a single publisher to single subscriber. The first application has a single publisher sending information out into the system and the second application has a single subscriber receiving that information.</p>
    </li>
