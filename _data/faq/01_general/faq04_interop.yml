Q: Is OpenDDS interoperable with other DDS implementations?

A: Starting with version 3.1, OpenDDS contains an implementation of the RTPS (Real Time Publish-Subscribe)
   specification required for interoperability.  It is not enabled by default.  See the OpenDDS Developer's
   Guide chapter 7 for configuration details.
