Join us on Wednesday, March 20 at the OMG Technical Meeting in Reston, VA (Washington, D.C. area) for a
[special event introducing the DDS Foundation](https://www.omg.org/events/va-19/special-events/DDS-Foundation.htm).
The DDS Foundation brings together technology companies, end users, developers,
and industry influencers to fulfill the mission of innovation and insight into
the future of the DDS standard. The event, which is open to the public, will
feature customers and case studies with a particular focus on the standard's
role in IIoT, robotics and defense. During the event, OCI will present a talk on
"Designing Flexible, Secure, and Efficient IoT Applications with DDS." A
complementary reception will follow the event. Attendees are welcome to network
with the speakers, Foundation officers, and other DDS users. While you're there,
visit OCI's exhibit to meet members of the OpenDDS team and to learn how
organizations are leveraging this open source solution, backed by OCI's DDS and
software engineering experts, to meet today's technical and business challenges.
