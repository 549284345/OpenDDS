The task of designing integrated solutions is frequently met with challenges when unusual architectural constraints from system and non-system sources are introduced into the equation. Normal integration patterns are desirable,but what happens when actors in your deployment introduce unique requirements?

In [this SETT article]({{ site.data.oci.homepage }}/resources/publications/sett/october-2019-dds-for-extremely-resource-constrained-environments), Object Computing Solutions Architect, Marc Neeley, explores how today's industry standards are addressing complex integration challenges and provides a detailed review of the OMG specification, DDS for eXtremely Resource Constrained Environments (DDS-XRCE), which plays a significant role in extending solutions into environments with unique requirements.
